/**
 * When a child object is taken from the \phi object, this class

 * for this scenario, for example:
 *
 * [] > parent
 *   memory TRUE > toggle
 *   toggle.while > @
 *     [x] > kid
 *       ^.^.write FALSE

 * Here, the "while" object has TRUE as its \rho, which would make
 * this loop endless: the "while" will always read from the TRUE constant.
 * Thus, we set \rho to the object while to "toggle".
