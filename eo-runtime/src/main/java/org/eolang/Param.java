 * retrieval this object also does simple type checking. When an attribute
 * is expected to be of some type, we use {@link #strong(Class)}. This method
 * will throw a runtime exception if types don't match. If just a simple
 * retrieval without type checking is necessary, just use the method
 * {@link #weak()}.
